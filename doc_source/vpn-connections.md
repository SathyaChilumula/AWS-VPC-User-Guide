# VPN Connections<a name="vpn-connections"></a>

You can connect your Amazon VPC to remote networks by using a VPN connection\. The following are some of the connectivity options available to you\.


| VPN connectivity option | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| AWS managed VPN  | You can create an IPsec VPN connection between your VPC and your remote network\. On the AWS side of the VPN connection, a virtual private gateway provides two VPN endpoints \(tunnels\) for automatic failover\. You configure your customer gateway on the remote side of the VPN connection\. For more information, see [AWS Managed VPN Connections](VPC_VPN.md), and the [Amazon VPC Network Administrator Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/adminguide/)\. | 
| AWS VPN CloudHub | If you have more than one remote network \(for example, multiple branch offices\), you can create multiple AWS managed VPN connections via your virtual private gateway to enable communication between these networks\. For more information, see [Providing Secure Communication Between Sites Using VPN CloudHub](VPN_CloudHub.md)\. | 
| Third party software VPN appliance | You can create a VPN connection to your remote network by using an Amazon EC2 instance in your VPC that's running a third party software VPN appliance\. AWS does not provide or maintain third party software VPN appliances; however, you can choose from a range of products provided by partners and open source communities\. Find third party software VPN appliances on the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results/ref=brs_navgno_search_box?searchTerms=vpn)\. | 

You can also use AWS Direct Connect to create a dedicated private connection from a remote network to your VPC\. You can combine this connection with an AWS managed VPN connection to create an IPsec\-encrypted connection\. For more information, see [What is AWS Direct Connect?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) in the *AWS Direct Connect User Guide*\. For more information about the different VPC and VPN connectivity options, see the [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud Connectivity Options](http://media.amazonwebservices.com/AWS_Amazon_VPC_Connectivity_Options.pdf) whitepaper\.
