# Getting Started with Amazon VPC<a name="vpc-getting-started"></a>

The following tutorials help you set up a nondefault VPC quickly\. If you need resources in your VPC to communicate over IPv6, you can set up a VPC with an associated IPv6 CIDR block\. Otherwise, set up a VPC with an associated IPv4 CIDR block\.

If you already have a default VPC, you can get started by launching instances into your default VPC, without creating or configuring a new VPC\. For more information, see [Launching an EC2 Instance into Your Default VPC](default-vpc.md#launching-into)\.
