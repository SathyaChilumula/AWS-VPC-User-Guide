# Working with VPCs and Subnets<a name="working-with-vpcs"></a>

The following procedures are for manually creating a VPC and subnets\. You also have to manually add gateways and routing tables\. Alternatively, you can use the Amazon VPC wizard to create a VPC plus its subnets, gateways, and routing tables in one step\. For more information, see [Scenarios and Examples](VPC_Scenarios.md)\.

## Creating a VPC<a name="Create-VPC"></a>

You can create an empty VPC using the Amazon VPC console\.

**To create a VPC using the console**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Your VPCs**, **Create VPC**\.

1. Specify the following VPC details as necessary and choose **Create VPC**\. 
   + **Name tag**: Optionally provide a name for your VPC\. Doing so creates a tag with a key of `Name` and the value that you specify\.
   + **IPv4 CIDR block**: Specify an IPv4 CIDR block for the VPC\. We recommend that you specify a CIDR block from the private \(non\-publicly routable\) IP address ranges as specified in [RFC 1918](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1918.html); for example, `10.0.0.0/16`, or `192.168.0.0/16`\. 
**Note**  
You can specify a range of publicly routable IPv4 addresses; however, we currently do not support direct access to the internet from publicly routable CIDR blocks in a VPC\. Windows instances cannot boot correctly if launched into a VPC with ranges from `224.0.0.0` to `255.255.255.255` \(Class D and Class E IP address ranges\)\. 
   + **IPv6 CIDR block**: Optionally associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC by choosing **Amazon\-provided IPv6 CIDR block**\.
   + **Tenancy**: Select a tenancy option\. Dedicated tenancy ensures that your instances run on single\-tenant hardware\. For more information, see [Dedicated Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-instance.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

Alternatively, you can use a command line tool\.

**To create a VPC using a command line tool**
+ [create\-vpc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-vpc.html) \(AWS CLI\)
+ [New\-EC2Vpc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-EC2Vpc.html) \(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\)

**To describe a VPC using a command line tool**
+ [describe\-vpcs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpcs.html) \(AWS CLI\)
+ [Get\-EC2Vpc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2Vpc.html) \(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\)

For more information about IP addresses, see [IP Addressing in Your VPC](vpc-ip-addressing.md)\.

After you've created a VPC, you can create subnets\. For more information, see [Creating a Subnet in Your VPC](#AddaSubnet)\.

## Creating a Subnet in Your VPC<a name="AddaSubnet"></a>

To add a new subnet to your VPC, you must specify an IPv4 CIDR block for the subnet from the range of your VPC\. You can specify the Availability Zone in which you want the subnet to reside\. You can have multiple subnets in the same Availability Zone\. 

You can optionally specify an IPv6 CIDR block for your subnet if an IPv6 CIDR block is associated with your VPC\.

**To add a subnet to your VPC using the console**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Subnets**, **Create Subnet**\.

1. Specify the subnet details as necessary and choose **Create Subnet**\.
   + **Name tag**: Optionally provide a name for your subnet\. Doing so creates a tag with a key of `Name` and the value that you specify\.
   + **VPC**: Choose the VPC for which you're creating the subnet\.
   + **Availability Zone**: Optionally choose an Availability Zone in which your subnet will reside, or leave the default **No Preference** to let AWS choose an Availability Zone for you\.
   + **IPv4 CIDR block**: Specify an IPv4 CIDR block for your subnet, for example, `10.0.1.0/24`\. For more information, see [VPC and Subnet Sizing for IPv4](VPC_Subnets.md#vpc-sizing-ipv4)\.
   + **IPv6 CIDR block**: \(Optional\) If you've associated an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC, choose **Specify a custom IPv6 CIDR**\. Specify the hexadecimal pair value for the subnet, or leave the default value\. 

1. \(Optional\) If required, repeat the steps above to create more subnets in your VPC\.

Alternatively, you can use a command line tool\.

**To add a subnet using a command line tool**
+ [create\-subnet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-subnet.html) \(AWS CLI\)
+ [New\-EC2Subnet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-EC2Subnet.html) \(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\)

**To describe a subnet using a command line tool**

+ [Get\-EC2Subnet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2Subnet.html) \(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\)

After you've created a subnet, you can do the following:
+ Configure your routing\. To make your subnet a public subnet, you must attach an internet gateway to your VPC\. For more information, see [Creating and Attaching an Internet Gateway](VPC_Internet_Gateway.md#Add_IGW_Attach_Gateway)\. You can then create a custom route table, and add route to the internet gateway\. For more information, see [Creating a Custom Route Table](VPC_Internet_Gateway.md#Add_IGW_Routing)\. For other routing options, see [Route Tables](VPC_Route_Tables.md)\.
+ Modify the subnet settings to specify that all instances launched in that subnet receive a public IPv4 address, or an IPv6 address, or both\. For more information, see [IP Addressing Behavior for Your Subnet](vpc-ip-addressing.md#vpc-ip-addressing-subnet)\.
+ Create or modify your security groups as needed\. For more information, see [Security Groups for Your VPC](VPC_SecurityGroups.md)\.
+ Create or modify your network ACLs as needed\. For more information, see [Network ACLs](vpc-network-acls.md)\.

## Associating a Secondary IPv4 CIDR Block with Your VPC<a name="add-ipv4-cidr"></a>

You can add another IPv4 CIDR block to your VPC\. Ensure that you have read the applicable [restrictions](VPC_Subnets.md#vpc-resize)\.

After you've associated a CIDR block, the status goes to `associating`\. The CIDR block is ready to use when it's in the `associated` state\.

**To add a CIDR block to your VPC using the console**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Your VPCs**\.

1. Select the VPC, and choose **Actions**, **Edit CIDRs**\.

1. Choose **Add IPv4 CIDR**, and enter the CIDR block to add; for example, `10.2.0.0/16`\. Choose the tick icon\.

1. Choose **Close**\.

## Deleting Your VPC<a name="VPC_Deleting"></a>

You can delete your VPC at any time\. However, you must terminate all instances in the VPC first\. When you delete a VPC using the VPC console, we delete all its components, such as subnets, security groups, network ACLs, route tables, internet gateways, VPC peering connections, and DHCP options\.

If you have a VPN connection, you don't have to delete it or the other components related to the VPN \(such as the customer gateway and virtual private gateway\)\. If you plan to use the customer gateway with another VPC, we recommend that you keep the VPN connection and the gateways\. Otherwise, your network administrator must configure the customer gateway again after you create a new VPN connection\. 

**To delete your VPC using the console**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. Terminate all instances in the VPC\. For more information, see [Terminate Your Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/terminating-instances.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Your VPCs**\.

1. Select the VPC to delete and choose **Actions**, **Delete VPC**\.

1. To delete the VPN connection, select the option to do so; otherwise, leave it unselected\. Choose **Yes, Delete**\.

Alternatively, you can use a command line tool\. When you delete a VPC using the command line, you must first terminate all instances, delete all subnets, custom security groups, and custom route tables, and detach any internet gateway in the VPC\.
