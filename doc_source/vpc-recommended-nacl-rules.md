# Recommended Network ACL Rules for Your VPC<a name="vpc-recommended-nacl-rules"></a>

The VPC wizard helps you implement common scenarios for Amazon VPC\. If you implement these scenarios as described in the documentation, you'll use the default network access control list \(ACL\), which allows all inbound and outbound traffic\. If you need an additional layer of security, you can create a network ACL and add rules\. For more information, see [Network ACLs](vpc-network-acls.md)\.

We recommend the following rules for each scenario\.

**Topics**
+ [Recommended Rules for Scenario 1](#nacl-rules-scenario-1)
+ [Recommended Rules for Scenario 2](#nacl-rules-scenario-2)
+ [Recommended Rules for Scenario 3](#nacl-rules-scenario-3)
+ [Recommended Rules for Scenario 4](#nacl-rules-scenario-4)<a name="nacl-rule-considerations"></a>

**Considerations**
+ We use the ephemeral port range 32768\-65535 as an example, or 1024\-65535 for a NAT gateway\. You must select a range that is appropriate for your configuration\. For more information, see [Ephemeral Ports](vpc-network-acls.md#nacl-ephemeral-ports)\.
+ If the maximum transmission unit \(MTU\) between hosts in your subnets is different, you must add the following rule, both inbound and outbound, to ensure that Path MTU Discovery can function correctly and prevent packet loss: select **Custom ICMP Rule** for the type and **Destination Unreachable**, **fragmentation required, and DF flag set** for the port range \(type 3, code 4\)\. If you use traceroute, also add the following rule: select **Custom ICMP Rule** for the type and **Time Exceeded**, **TTL expired transit** for the port range \(type 11, code 0\)\. For more information, see [Network Maximum Transmission Unit \(MTU\) for Your EC2 Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/network_mtu.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

## Recommended Rules for Scenario 1<a name="nacl-rules-scenario-1"></a>

Scenario 1 is a single subnet with instances that can receive and send Internet traffic\. For more information, see [Scenario 1: VPC with a Single Public Subnet](VPC_Scenario1.md)\.

The following table shows the rules we recommended\. They block all traffic except that which is explicitly required\.


|  |

This range is an example only\. For information about choosing the correct ephemeral ports for your configuration, see [Ephemeral Ports](vpc-network-acls.md#nacl-ephemeral-ports)\.  | 
|  \*  |  0\.0\.0\.0/0  |  all  |  all  |  DENY  |  Denies all outbound IPv4 traffic not already handled by a preceding rule \(not modifiable\)\.  | 

### Recommended Rules for IPv6<a name="vpc-nacls-scenario-1-ipv6"></a>

If you implemented scenario 1 with IPv6 support and created a VPC and subnet with associated IPv6 CIDR blocks, you must add separate rules to your network ACL to control inbound and outbound IPv6 traffic\. 

The following are the IPv6\-specific rules for your network ACL \(which are in addition to the rules listed above\)\.


|  | 
| --- |
|  Inbound  | 
|  Rule \#  |  Source IP  |  Protocol  |  Port  |  Allow/Deny  |  Comments  | 
|  150  |  ::/0  |  TCP  |  80  |  ALLOW  |  Allows inbound HTTP traffic from any IPv6 address\.  | 
|  160  |  ::/0  |  TCP  |  443  |  ALLOW  |  Allows inbound HTTPS traffic from any IPv6 address\.  | 
|  170  |  IPv6 address range of your home network  |  TCP  |  22  |  ALLOW  |  Allows inbound SSH traffic from your home network \(over the Internet gateway\)\.  | 
|  180  |  IPv6 address range of your home network  |  TCP  |  3389  |  ALLOW  |  Allows inbound RDP traffic from your home network \(over the Internet gateway\)\.  | 
|  190  |  ::/0  |  TCP  |  32768\-65535  |  ALLOW  |  Allows inbound return traffic from hosts on the Internet that are responding to requests originating in the subnet\. This range is an example only\. For information about choosing the correct ephemeral ports for your configuration, see [Ephemeral Ports](vpc-network-acls.md#nacl-ephemeral-ports)\.  | 
|  \*  |  ::/0  |  all  |  all  |  DENY  |  Denies all inbound IPv6 traffic not already handled by a preceding rule \(not modifiable\)\.  | 
|  Outbound  | 
|  Rule \#  |  Dest IP  |  Protocol  |  Port  |  Allow/Deny  |  Comments  | 
|  130  |  ::/0  |  TCP  |  80  |  ALLOW  |  Allows outbound HTTP traffic from the subnet to the Internet\.  | 
|  140  |  ::/0  |  TCP  |  443  |  ALLOW  |  Allows outbound HTTPS traffic from the subnet to the Internet\.  | 
|  150  |  ::/0  |  TCP  |  32768\-65535  |  ALLOW  |  Allows outbound responses to clients on the Internet \(for example, serving web pages to people visiting the web servers in the subnet\)\. This range is an example only\. For information about choosing the correct ephemeral ports for your configuration, see [Ephemeral Ports](vpc-network-acls.md#nacl-ephemeral-ports)\.  | 
|  \*  |  ::/0  |  all  |  all  |  DENY  |  Denies all outbound IPv6 traffic not already handled by a preceding rule \(not modifiable\)\.  | 

## Recommended Rules for Scenario 2<a name="nacl-rules-scenario-2"></a>

Scenario 2 is a public subnet with instances that can receive and send Internet traffic, and a private subnet that can't receive traffic directly from the Internet\. However, it can initiate traffic to the Internet \(and receive responses\) through a NAT gateway or NAT instance in the public subnet\. For more information, see [Scenario 2: VPC with Public and Private Subnets \(NAT\)](VPC_Scenario2.md)\.

For this scenario you have a network ACL for the public subnet, and a separate one for the private subnet\. The following table shows the rules we recommend for each ACL\. They block all traffic except that which is explicitly required\. They mostly mimic the security group rules for the scenario\.

## Recommended Rules for Scenario 3<a name="nacl-rules-scenario-3"></a>

Scenario 3 is a public subnet with instances that can receive and send Internet traffic, and a VPN\-only subnet with instances that can communicate only with your home network over the VPN connection\. For more information, see [Scenario 3: VPC with Public and Private Subnets and AWS Managed VPN Access](VPC_Scenario3.md)\.

For this scenario you have a network ACL for the public subnet, and a separate one for the VPN\-only subnet\. The following table shows the rules we recommend for each ACL\. They block all traffic except that which is explicitly required\.

## Recommended Rules for Scenario 4<a name="nacl-rules-scenario-4"></a>

Scenario 4 is a single subnet with instances that can communicate only with your home network over a VPN connection\. For a more information, see [Scenario 4: VPC with a Private Subnet Only and AWS Managed VPN Access](VPC_Scenario4.md)\.

The following table shows the rules we recommended\. They block all traffic except that which is explicitly required\.

|  Rule \#  |  Source IP  |  Protocol  |  Port  |  Allow/Deny  |  Comments  | 
|  100  |  Private IP address range of your home network  |  TCP  |  22  |  ALLOW  |  Allows inbound SSH traffic to the subnet from your home network\.  | 
|  110  |  Private IP address range of your home network  |  TCP  |  3389  |  ALLOW  |  Allows inbound RDP traffic to the subnet from your home network\.  | 
|  120  |  Private IP address range of your home network  |  TCP  |  32768\-65535  |  ALLOW  |  Allows inbound return traffic from requests originating in the subnet\. This range is an example only\. For information about choosing the correct ephemeral ports for your configuration, see [Ephemeral Ports](vpc-network-acls.md#nacl-ephemeral-ports)\.  | 
|  \*  |  0\.0\.0\.0/0  |  all  |  all  |  DENY  |  Denies all inbound traffic not already handled by a preceding rule \(not modifiable\)\.  | 
|  Outbound  | 
|  Rule \#  |  Dest IP  |  Protocol  |  Port  |  Allow/Deny  |  Comments  | 
|  100  |  Private IP address range of your home network  |  All  |  All  |  ALLOW  |  Allows all outbound traffic from the subnet to your home network\. This rule also covers rule 120; however, you can make this rule more restrictive by using a specific protocol type and port number\. If you make this rule more restrictive, then you must include rule 120 in your network ACL to ensure that outbound responses are not blocked\.   | 
|  120  |  Private IP address range of your home network  |  TCP  |  32768\-65535  |  ALLOW  |  Allows outbound responses to clients in the home network\. This range is an example only\. For information about choosing the correct ephemeral ports for your configuration, see [Ephemeral Ports](vpc-network-acls.md#nacl-ephemeral-ports)\.  | 
|  \*  |  0\.0\.0\.0/0  |  all  |  all  |  DENY  |  Denies all outbound traffic not already handled by a preceding rule \(not modifiable\)\.  | 

### Recommended Rules for IPv6<a name="vpc-nacls-scenario-4-ipv6"></a>

If you implemented scenario 4 with IPv6 support and created a VPC and subnet with associated IPv6 CIDR blocks, you must add separate rules to your network ACL to control inbound and outbound IPv6 traffic\. 

In this scenario, the database servers cannot be reached over the VPN communication via IPv6, therefore no additional network ACL rules are required\. The following are the default rules that deny IPv6 traffic to and from the subnet\.
